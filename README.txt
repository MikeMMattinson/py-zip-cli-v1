Run the tool from the command line using Python or a bundled .exe.

    zip-cli-v1.0.0.exe <folder> [--options]

Available Options:

    --filter <pattern>         Include files matching one or more glob patterns (e.g. "*.txt").

    --exclude <pattern>        Exclude files matching one or more glob patterns.

    --include <pattern>        Same as --filter (takes precedence if both are used).

    --date-format <format>     Customize the timestamp format used in the ZIP filename.
                               Default: "%Y%m%dT%H%M"

    --inventory                Print a list of all files included in the archive.

    --backup-location <path>   Folder where the .zip file will be saved. Defaults to current directory.

    zip-cli-v1.0.0.exe myfolder

    zip-cli-v1.0.0.exe data --filter "*.csv" --exclude "secret*"

    zip-cli-v1.0.0.exe reports --include "*.pdf" --date-format "%Y-%m-%d" --inventory

    zip-cli-v1.0.0.exe logs --filter "*.log" --backup-location P:\Backups
